# Brian's Landing Page

Brian Carter's landing page for developers, students, and all.

With our new virus situation, I don't get to present in person and talk much .. so here's my minimal landing page for sharing my artifacts.

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

I wanted a landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather beautiful and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

I wanted a landing page where I can add markdown links - links to my classes and articles. Provide a central spot to share and link to my stuff.

So I sat down one night and created this **Landing Page**. Feel free to fork, clone, play around and make this your own.

## Themes

BC's Landing Page comes in 10 **material themes**.

If none of these themes fit within your taste, it's quite easy to customize and create your own too. 

## GitHub Pages

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how or follow the steps below.

If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`

Here's my **Landing Page** - [Brian Carter - portfolio v1](https://bcphd.com)

### Custom Domain

If you want to make your new landing page available under a domain like `{username}.com` you can get started here - [Setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/).
