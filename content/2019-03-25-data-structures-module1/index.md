Welcome to Data Structures, my name is BC (Brian, Dr. Carter ...) and I will be your instructor for this course.

For Sullivan students - the syllabus is published <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C5f3ghaqnI8Xy0u2OXldvfwgJegvYnkIWpySiuGQT40/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">HERE</a>

DATA STRUCTURES  
This course examines fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. Emphasis is placed on implementing these structures to develop advanced programs to handle a variety of common programming tasks. 

## Goals of the Course

- Become familiar with some of the fundamental data structures in computer science
- Improve ability to solve problems abstractly
  - data structures are the building blocks
- Improve ability to analyze your algorithms
  - prove correctness
  - gauge (and improve) time complexity

### Observation

- All programs manipulate data
  - programs process, store, display, gather
  - data can be information, numbers, images, sound
- Each program must decide how to store data
- Choice influences program at every level
  - execution speed
  - memory requirements
  - maintenance (debugging, extending, etc.)

### What is a Data Structure?
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations (algorithms) that can be applied to the data. 

### Next Modules
In the next module, module 2, we will cover data types and arrays.
